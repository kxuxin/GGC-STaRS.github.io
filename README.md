Layout:

_config.yml contains  is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files feature for the data you need to update frequently.

index.html contains the layout (stars2022)

posters.md contains the posters and layouts, as of now it interfaces with 2021 posters (site.data.stars2021.posters)

archives.md is the archive of the 2021 site
